10    truncated         Indicates whether the value of the text parameter was truncated, for example, as a result of a retweet exceeding the 140 character Tweet length. Truncated text will end in ellipsis, like this ... Since Twitter now rejects long Tweets vs truncating them, the large majority of Tweets will have this set to false . Note that while native retweets may have their toplevel text property shortened, the original text will be available under the retweeted_status object and the truncated parameter will be set to the value of the original status (in most cases, false ).
